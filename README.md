# EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE WITH FACE RECOGNITION (PROTOTYPE)

This project just a testing/prototype from me.

This project creates an "Employee Attendance System" using Face Recognition :

- The way it works is that office employees will take attendance via webcam/camera  
- The system will process the employee's identity by looking at the face of the employee whose photo has been entered into the database.
- After processing, the employee's identity information will be visible on the right side of the camera UI and will be marked as having been present today.
